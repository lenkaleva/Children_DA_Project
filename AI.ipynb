      "Thank you for sharing those details. It looks like your child has a low soft-drink intake (soft_drinks_map: 1) and a fairly active social life (friend_talk_map: 7). That’s a solid base to build on. Here are practical, child-friendly ideas to help prevent obesity, tailored to these cues:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Nourishing beverages\n",
      "  - Keep water readily available and make it the go-to drink.\n",
      "  - If you use them, choose small amounts of unsweetened or lightly flavored water instead of sugary drinks.\n",
      "  - When offering juice, limit to no more than 4–6 oz per day (prefer 100% fruit juice) and pair with meals rather than as a snack.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Make meals and snacks balanced\n",
      "  - Plan regular meals and healthy snacks that include protein, fiber, and healthy fats (e.g., yogurt with fruit, whole-grain bread with lean protein, veggies with hummus).\n",
      "  - Encourage your child to help with grocery shopping and simple meal prep to boost interest and ownership.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Leverage peer influence in a positive way\n",
      "  - Since your child has active conversations with friends, invite friends to join in active activities (bike rides, sports, dance, or groups like a fun run or martial arts class).\n",
      "  - Encourage healthy social activities (family walks after meals, weekend park visits) that keep kids moving without making exercise feel like a chore.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Move more, sit less\n",
      "  - Aim for about 60 minutes or more of physical activity most days. It can be broken into shorter bouts (e.g., 15 minutes after school, 15 minutes before dinner).\n",
      "  - Make it a family habit: weekend hikes, bike rides, or team games.\n",
      "  - Limit sedentary time by setting reasonable screen-time boundaries and encouraging active breaks during long screen sessions.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Sleep and daily routine\n",
      "  - Ensure age-appropriate sleep duration and a consistent bedtime routine. Poor sleep can affect appetite and energy.\n",
      "  - Create regular meal and activity schedules to reduce grazing and late-night snacking.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Environment and habits at home\n",
      "  - Stock fruits, vegetables, and healthy snack options within easy reach.\n",
      "  - Avoid using food as a reward; celebrate achievements with non-food rewards (a trip to the park, a new book, a game).\n",
      "  - Talk with your child about cravings and hunger cues in a calm, non-judgmental way.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Gentle guidance and growth mindset\n",
      "  - Emphasize health and energy for daily activities rather than weight alone.\n",
      "  - Involve your child in goal setting (e.g., “This week, we’ll try two new vegetables,” or “Let’s be active 5 days this week”) and celebrate progress.\n",
      "\n",
      "- When to seek extra help\n",
      "  - If you’re worried about weight, growth patterns, or a specific health issue, consider talking with a pediatrician or a registered dietitian for personalized advice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Would you like me to tailor a simple weekly plan for your child’s age, daily schedule, and activities? If you share your child’s age and typical day (school days vs. weekends), I can draft a practical routine with meals, activities, and coping strategies.\n"
